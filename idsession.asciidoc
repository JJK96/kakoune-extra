idsession.kak
=============

The default name for a new session is the process ID of the server,
which makes it difficult to differenciate one session from another. The
`idsession` command fixes that by renaming the current session into a name
that's human-readable (hyphen separated adjective/noun pair).

Commands
--------

idsession
~~~~~~~~~

Rename the current session. The current session name is expected to be a
number to use as a seed, which is the case in a new session (the process
ID of the server is the session name). If the session name is not a number,
`0` will be used as a seed.

The seed is subsequently used to pick an adjective and a noun that will
make up the resulting session name. The selection is a simple modulo,
which makes the outcome of this function deterministic for the same seed.

To automatically rename new sessions, call this command from a hook:

```
hook global KakBegin .* idsession
```

Variables
---------

idsession_adjectives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of adjectives that will make up the first part of the adjective/noun
pair.

The default list of adjectives contain words that start with the letter
`k`, e.g. "katari".

idsession_names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List of nouns that will make up the second part of the adjective/noun pair.

The default list of nouns contain words that start with the letter `k`,
