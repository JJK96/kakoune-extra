===============

The `search-marks` command allows showing how many matches each line holds,
after a search was performed.

Commands
--------

search-marks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Interfacing command that takes a search primitive as first argument, which
can be any of the builtin primitives (`/`, `<a-/>` etc), or a custom mapping
declared by the user.

The command prompts the user for a pattern, which will be passed to
the search primitive upon validation of the prompt, and a `flag-lines`
highlighter added to the current window.

If no matches result from the search, the highlighter is removed from
the window.

Faces
-----

SearchMark
~~~~~~~~~~

Face applied to the line flags that indicate the amount of matches on the line.

Example
-------

The following mappings override the builtin search primitives to use the
markers command interface:


```
map -docstring 'search with markers' global normal '/' %{: search-marks /<ret>}
map -docstring 'backward search with markers' global normal '<a-/>' %{: search-marks <lt>a-/><ret>}
map -docstring 'extend search with markers' global normal '?' %{: search-marks ?<ret>}
map -docstring 'backward extend search with markers' global normal '<a-?>' %{: search-marks <lt>a-?><ret>}
```
