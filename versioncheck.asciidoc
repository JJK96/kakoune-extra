versioncheck.kak
================

When the editor starts, a hook fetches the version number of the latest
stable release on Github, and compares it with the local version of the
running instance.

The state of the comparison is printed on the debug buffer, along with
context information: whether the local instance is up to date, its version,
the upstream stable version etc.

A development version is always considered up-to-date with its associated
stable, e.g. `v2018.09.04-65-gdbfed130` is considered aligned with
`v2018.09.04`.

Example output:

```
Local version: v2018.09.04-65-gdbfed130
Upstream version: v2018.09.04
Up to date
```
